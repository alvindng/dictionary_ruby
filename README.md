#### _Individual Ruby Exercise for Epicodus - Ruby week 2, 7.8.16._

#### By _**Alvin Ng**_

## Description
**Dictionary**

Website showcasing everything I learned in week 2 Ruby of Epicodus. This application is to incorporate all the concepts taught this week by creating a webpage (using HTML and Ruby) that contains two classes: One for Word, and one for Definition. The homepage of the app should list all words, and let you click on them to view all of their definitions. A user should be able to add a word, and when viewing a word, be able to add one or more definitions.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Download/clone repository, or visit
https://degrassi-syrup-35998.herokuapp.com/
* To add a word, click the "Add a New Word" Link
* Fill out the form to add a new word
* Click on the word to see its definitions
* Click on "Add a Definition" button to add a definition
* Fill out the form to add a definition to the word
